Data Cleaning and Value for Money Calculation
Overview
This project involves two main steps:

Data Cleaning: Preparing the dataset for analysis by addressing missing values and ensuring data types are correct.
Value for Money Calculation: Computing a metric to evaluate how well a player's performance justifies their wage.
1. Data Cleaning
Objective: Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis by handling missing values and converting data types.

Steps:

Load the Data:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('players.csv')
Clean the Data:

Remove Missing Values:

python
Copy code
df = df.dropna(subset=['overall_rating', 'wage_euro'])
Convert Data Types:

python
Copy code
df['birth_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['birth_date'])
df['wage_euro'] = pd.to_numeric(df['wage_euro'], errors='coerce')
Save Cleaned Data:

python
Copy code
df.to_csv('cleaned_players.csv', index=False)
2. Value for Money Calculation
Objective: Calculate the value_for_money metric, which evaluates the performance a player provides per unit of wage spent.

Steps:

Load Cleaned Data:

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_players.csv')
Calculate Value for Money:

python
Copy code
df['value_for_money'] = df['overall_rating'] / df['wage_euro']
Save Results:

python
Copy code
df.to_csv('players_with_value_for_money.csv', index=False)
Verify Results (Optional):

python
Copy code
print(df[['full_name', 'overall_rating', 'wage_euro', 'value_for_money']].head())
Key Points
Data Cleaning: Ensures that only complete and correctly formatted data is used for analysis.
Value for Money Calculation: Provides insight into how efficiently players' wages translate into performance.
Benefits
Preparation for Analysis: Cleaned data ensures accurate and reliable calculations.
Decision-Making: value_for_money metric helps in evaluating player acquisition and budget allocation based on performance relative to cost.
